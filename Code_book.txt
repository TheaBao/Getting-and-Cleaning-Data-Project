#CodeBook
This is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

A full description of the data is available at the site where the data was obtained: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

##Descriptions of the Data Set

The dataset includes the following files:

'README.txt'

'features_info.txt': Information about the variables used on the features.

'features.txt': List of all features.

'activity_labels.txt': Links the activity names with labels.

'train/X_train.txt': Training data set.

'train/y_train.txt': Training activity labels.

'train/subject_train.txt': subjects who performed the activity for each train sample.

'test/X_test.txt': Test data set.

'test/y_test.txt': Test activity labels.

'test/subject_test.txt': subjects who performed the activity for each test sample.


##Feature Selection 

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.


The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation


In the "tidy_dataset.txt" file, the average of each variable from original data set is calculated and grouped by subject and activity.


##Transformations within run_analysis.R

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
